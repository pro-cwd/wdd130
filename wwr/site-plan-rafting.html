    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Jungle rivers in the Amazon part of the Andes are generally larger 
        and have more consistent flows than those in the western Andes. 
        They are also the cleanest and most picturesque rivers in all of Ecuador. 
        In addition to its exceptional whitewater, the rivers of eastern Ecuador 
        also offer the opportunity to experience the incredible Amazon rainforest 
        and the rhythm of life of its native inhabitants.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p><b>Who can go rafting?</b> This question has many variables. However, 
        the answer is everyone who wants to do it. Since there are 6 levels 
        of difficulty of rapid water, the passenger can choose the one that 
        best suits the level of adrenaline he wants to experience. To know 
        more about the different classes of fast waters please review the 
        Classification of Rivers. On the other hand, the minimum age for 
        rafting is 4 years (Rivers class II like the Anzu or Napo river) 
        and the maximum age depends on the physical condition of the passenger.</p>
