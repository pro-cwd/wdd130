        GRAFIC  DESIGN
        Branding and logo
        A good logo must be original. You have to design your logo very carefully and make sure that it stands out from the logos used by the competition. Another important factor is to create a logo that is attractive to potential clients of the brand.

        corporate image design
        The importance of design in the corporate image lies in building a bridge that allows customers to become visually familiar with the company through the use of representative graphic elements that convey a coherent concept.

        Now it is difficult to imagine a business or organization that does not need good advice in the development of your company's image, either for logo design or to develop your corporate identity.

        FRON-END DEVELOPER
        An effective web page is one that allows you to get potential clients while you focus on other areas. Its function is similar to that of a commercial.
        To create an effective web page we recommend you follow these 4 steps:
        Carry out a company audit to find out where you stand.
        Define the objectives and the strategy to achieve an effective web page.
        Create the content of the web page, distribute it in pages and build the structure or web architecture.
        Create the design of your website and decide how you are going to implement your website.
